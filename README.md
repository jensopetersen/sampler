sampler
=======

Thisisn't attempting to be a complete list of all TEI 
accessible on the internet, but a diverse sample. Diverse 
in terms of language, structure, linguistics, coding, tools 
in use, hosting method, etc, etc. We welcome a handful of 
small files (or one or two large ones) from any person / 
project / group that publishes their TEI on the internet. 

We are particularly interested in TEI files which are used 
as test files / sample in larger projects, because these 
are seen as key drivers of interoperability. 

Those hosting TEI in geographies which charge for internet 
bandwidth by the byte (za, nz, etc) may wish to think 
carefully about being included, We'll be happy to remove URLs 
on request.
